## Summary

This was created using the starter project provided from Udacity(source: https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page). The source code uses HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. The goal of this project is to transform this from a static project to an interactive one, which will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
