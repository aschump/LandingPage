## Summary

This was created using the starter project provided from Udacity(source: https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page). The source code uses HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. The goal of this project is to transform this from a static project to an interactive one, which will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Author
The primary author of this repo is me, Ember Schumpert, created with the starter code provided by Udacity. 

## Dependencies
Any code editor that can read JS, HTML, CSS

## Usage
To use this, simply download the zip file/clone through Github and load into your code editor.

## SetUp
Load html doc to view
